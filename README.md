# Learning Notes

Taking notes on some of the books I have read or other media that I have consumed.

If you are looking for an easy way to consume these notes, please check out [stuff13.github.io/learning-notes/](https://stuff13.github.io/learning-notes/).
This project's code was ruthlessly stolen from [keyvanakbary](https://github.com/keyvanakbary/learning-notes)[^1]
